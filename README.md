# MathRAGBot - Chat Agent that uses RAG to solve Math Word Problems

This repository contains the implementation of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model using AstraDB and OpenAI's embeddings. It is designed to demonstrate how you can leverage AstraDB's vector storage capabilities to perform similarity searches on a dataset of documents, using embeddings generated by OpenAI models.

## Features

- Uses OpenAI's embedding models for generating vector representations of documents.
- Stores and retrieves documents using AstraDB's vector storage capabilities.
- Includes a sample retrieval of documents based on similarity search.

## Requirements

Before running this code, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.7+
- `langchain_astradb`
- `transformers`
- `langchain_openai`
- `langchain_core`
- `datasets`

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install langchain_astradb transformers langchain_openai langchain_core datasets

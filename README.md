# MathRAGBot - Chat Agent that uses RAG to solve Math Word Problems

This repository contains the implementation of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model using AstraDB and OpenAI's embeddings. It is designed to demonstrate how you can leverage AstraDB's vector storage capabilities to perform similarity searches on a dataset of documents, using embeddings generated by OpenAI models.

## Features

- Uses OpenAI's embedding models for generating vector representations of documents.
- Stores and retrieves documents using AstraDB's vector storage capabilities.
- Includes a sample retrieval of documents based on similarity search.

## Requirements

Before running this code, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.7+
- `langchain_astradb`
- `transformers`
- `langchain_openai`
- `langchain_core`
- `datasets`

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install langchain_astradb transformers langchain_openai langchain_core datasets


## Dataset

The code uses the `microsoft/orca-math-word-problems-200k` dataset from the Hugging Face `datasets` library. This dataset contains over 200,000 math word problems, which are used to demonstrate the capabilities of the retrieval-augmented generation system. You can modify the script to use any dataset of your choosing by replacing the dataset identifier with your preferred dataset available in the Hugging Face library.

Example change to use a different dataset:

```python
# Replace the line below with the identifier of your chosen dataset
orca_dataset = load_dataset("new_dataset_identifier", split='train')
